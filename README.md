This project was implemented as part of a follow-along learning exercise inspired by Amlan Mohanty’s
 YouTube tutorial:
“Advanced Data Analysis Portfolio Project using Retail Customer Data.”

All data analysis, queries, and dashboard design have been reimplemented with personal modifications and tools.
